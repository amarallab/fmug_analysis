Find My Understudied Genes (FMUG) is a data-driven tool to helps biologists identify understudied genes and characterize their tractability for future research.

More information is available at [fmug.amaral.northwestern.edu](https://fmug.amaral.northwestern.edu/).

The data table underlying FMUG is available [here](https://github.com/amarallab/fmug_analysis/blob/main/data/main_table_with_subject_counts_221116.csv).
